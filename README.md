# Nemidoonam Kodoom 🎲

**"نمیدونم کدوم"** or **Pick-for-me** is a simple yet dynamic decision helper built with Laravel and Vue.js. You give it two options — it randomly picks one, saving you from indecision with a bit of charm!

## 📌 Project Summary

This is a fully dynamic web app where the frontend is powered by **Vue.js** and styled beautifully with **custom animations** and a soft, playful UI. It helps users decide between two options they input, using a random selector.

> The main goal was to make a fun, fast, and expressive experience for Persian-speaking users — though the interface and codebase can be easily adapted to other languages.
